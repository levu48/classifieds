It purges duplicate modules from the output bundle and prevents modules from loading several times.\n\n## Why?\nA large dependency tree may include multiple versions of the same module, which may result in it being bundled multiple times, greatly increasing the bundle's size.\n\n#### What about `npm dedupe`?\nIt can be sufficient, but is sometimes hamstrung as third party modules may be asking for incompatible versions of the same library.\n\n#### What about `peerDependencies`?\nHopefully solves this problem in the future, but currently difficult to work with: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6565\n\n#### What about Browserify's own dedupe?\nIt currently only dedupes identical source files. Even if deduped, a library may be instantiated several times. \n\nE.g., even if Angular is deduped and only bundled once, you may still see: \n```\nWARNING: Tried to load angular more than once.\n```\n\n## How to use\nPass either an array of package names to dedupe or \"*\" to dedupe everything possible.\n\n```javascript\nvar resolutions = require('browserify-resolutions');\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Dedupe Angular\nbrowserify(options)\n  .plugin(resolutions, ['angular'])\n  .bundle();\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Dedupe everything possible\nbrowserify(options)\n  .plugin(resolutions, '*')\n  .bundle();\n```\n",
