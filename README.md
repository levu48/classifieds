Banmua is a classified ads and directory website integrated with software agent technology.
Sellers and buyers can create software agents using rule-based expert systems to express
what they are looking for and how to conduct negotiation. Agents run in the background
listening and communicating with other agents to find what are needed for their owners.

The website is still under construction, but the main pieces of technogy are integrated.
It is developed with Meteor 1.3beta, React, Material-UI, MongoDB, Leaflet, Google Map, I18N 
and Nools.

It is live for testing at http://banmua.us. Its server is hosted by galaxy.meteor.com
with database service comes from compose.io. Beware that it is still under active construction.
